# Course Name: Vue 3 - Composition Syntax

This repository is for the course Vue 3 - Composition Syntax on LinkedIn Learning.  Each module is contained in a folder with the module name. These module folders have a before and after folder to show how the project is started and how it should look when the module is completed. The /after folder contains the final state of the project after the module is completed.  You can use this as a reference if you get stuck or want to see the ending version.  

## Instructions

When starting the course, you'll want to get the /starting folder and use that as your starting point.
